# myFirstChromeExtension-LeadsTracker
This is my first chrome extension, read the README file to learn more about it. Thanks and have a good day! Coding along with Per from Scrimba.com in a freeCodeCamp video, all the other projects are in the learn.java.script but from now on I'll make each project individually. I've learned so much from this and I can't wait to continue on with programing.
